# Expense Tracker App â€“ Assignment 3

This project was created as part of the **FFU1200 Frontend Development** course. It is a simple expense tracker built using **React** to practice key concepts like component-based architecture, hooks, local storage, and form validation. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, filter, and store expense data. It is structured in a clean and beginner-friendly way, using Vite for the development environment and Git for version control. This README was drafted by ChatGPT and refined by the author.
